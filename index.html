	These are great questions, and the story goes like this..

	A residential house cleaning company actually started as an idea to get out of the military, until it was what was paying the bills immediately after Michael honorably separated from the military. Michael served in the United States Air Force leaving his job at Langley Air Force Base as a low observables aircraft structural maintenance journeyman behind to become his own boss. 

	After creating So Clean Virginia Beach the company and idea vastly became a huge success and so he and his partner, Anel, decided to start growing in other areas. Syracuse, NY is his business and life partners home town so naturally it seemed like the perfect place to make the next mark of success in!
